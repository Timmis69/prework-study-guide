# <Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage>

## Description

My motivation when creating this webpage was to publish the skills I learnt as I went. I built is as it is a useful resource should I need to look at my notes later downt the line. Creating it assisted my learning experience and saves me needing to use a notebook to keep notes manually. I learnt a lot whilst creating this webpage. Proir to now, I have never created my own website, I literally had to learn from the ground up. I did learn that I am capable of far more than I have allowed myself to believe, up until now...
